# Blacklight v2 — developer entry points.
#
# Every target works from a clean checkout with Go and Node installed. The SDKs
# in sdk/ add two more toolchains, both already in the devcontainer: `uv` for
# the Python generator and Docker for the Rust one (see the SDK section below).
#
# `make tools` is the only target that needs network access; `make generate`
# runs entirely from ./bin, the locked uv environment and the already-pulled
# generator image afterwards.

# has something better, and a 3.1 document read through a 3.0 downconverter in
# all of them. docs/sdk.md is the reasoning in full.
