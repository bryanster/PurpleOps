    r"""Create a service token, shown once.

     Mints a token owned by you. **The response is the only time its secret
    exists outside your client** — it is stored as a hash and cannot be
    recovered, so a caller that does not save it has to create another one.

    What the token may do is fenced twice, and the narrower fence wins on
    every request:

    1. The scopes you give it here.
    2. Your own permissions, read live on every request the token makes.
       Being demoted narrows every token you hold, immediately, without
       touching them; having your account disabled stops them entirely.

    `engagementId` adds a third fence, and only ever subtracts: a token
    bound to an engagement reaches that engagement and nothing else — not
    another engagement, not the installation — whatever its scopes say. It
    cannot let a token into an engagement you are not a member of.

    `expiresAt` is required and is capped at a year out. A credential with
    no expiry is one nobody remembers to revoke.

    A service token cannot call this. Creating credentials takes a signed-in
    session, so that a leaked token cannot mint a longer-lived replacement
    for itself and outlive its own revocation — `403` with `code:
    \"forbidden\"` when one tries, whatever scopes it carries.

    Args:
        x_csrf_token (str | Unset):
        body (CreateServiceTokenRequest): Body of `POST /auth/tokens`. The owner is the caller and
            is not a field.

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
