    them rather than reading them.

    **Live** means what the authentication middleware means by it: not
    revoked, not past its absolute expiry, and not idle for longer than the
    idle timeout. The same function decides both, so this list cannot

    revoking one worth doing.

    client should not offer an ordinary \"revoke\" for: ending it is signing
    out, and `POST /auth/logout` is where that lives, with the cookie
    clearing that goes with it.

    No token and no hash of one. What is in the cookie stays in the cookie.
