    r"""List the ATT&CK releases upstream offers, and which are installed.

     Any authenticated subject (`content.read`). Reads the ATT&CK source's
    published release index — the same index a sync with no pin uses to
    resolve \"latest\" — and merges it with the versions this installation
    already holds. It is what the first-run version picker is built on.

    This reaches upstream while the request is open. It takes no job slot
    and writes nothing; choosing a release and calling
    `POST /content/sources/{sourceId}/sync` is what installs one.

    **An upstream that cannot be reached is a `200`, not a `502`.**
    Air-gapped installations are supported, and for them an unreachable
    index is the normal case rather than a fault. The answer says
    `reachable: false`, carries the transport error in `unreachable`, and
    still lists what is installed — so a client can offer the offline bundle
    path (`docs/content-bundles.md`) instead of a dead end. `latest` is
    absent from every item when upstream did not answer: nothing local knows
    which release is newest, and ATT&CK labels do not sort.

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
        httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.
