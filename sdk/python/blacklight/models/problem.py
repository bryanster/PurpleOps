    `detail` and never on the status alone.

    Each code maps to exactly one HTTP status; the mapping lives in
    internal/httpapi/apierr and a test there asserts it (M0B-007). Adding a
    code means adding it in both places in the same change.

    The reverse is *nearly* 1:1. A code may refine another — same status,
    more specific instruction — and `mfa_enrolment_required` is the one that
    does, refining `forbidden`. A client that does not know a refinement can
    always fall back to the code it refines, and internal/httpapi/apierr
    holds the refinement table that says which that is.

    a URI that resolves to nothing.
