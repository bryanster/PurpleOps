# Blacklight v2 — Ticket Backlog

Every ticket here derives from [`PLAN.md`](../../PLAN.md). If a ticket and `PLAN.md` disagree,
`PLAN.md` wins — raise it rather than guessing. **Exception:** locked epic decision tables (e.g.
[`M3-EPIC.md`](done/M3-EPIC.md) “no rounds”, [`M4-EPIC.md`](done/M4-EPIC.md) collaboration) are
explicit, reviewed deviations — follow the epic for that milestone and update `PLAN.md` when the
deviation is permanent.

> **Standing deviation — rounds.** `PLAN.md` §2 (`round` table, `(step_id, round_id)` grain), §5
> (round-over-round) and §9 steps 6–7 describe retest rounds. M3 dropped them and
> [`M5-EPIC.md`](M5-EPIC.md) locked the replacement — ad-hoc **cross-engagement compare**. Both
> milestones are decided; `PLAN.md` has not been rewritten to match. Read the epics for rounds,
> not the plan.

## How to read a ticket

Each ticket is one file, named `<ID>-<slug>.md`, and contains:

| Section | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Why** | The user-visible or structural reason this exists. Read this before the scope. |
| **Scope** | Explicitly in, and explicitly out. Do not widen it — open a follow-up ticket instead. |
| **Files** | Where the code goes. Paths are suggestions with a strong prior; deviating needs a reason. |
| **Acceptance criteria** | Checkable statements. A reviewer runs down this list. |
| **Tests** | What must exist before this is reviewable. |
| **Depends on** | Tickets that must be merged first. |
| **Size** | S ≈ half a day, M ≈ 1–2 days, L ≈ 3–5 days, for someone new to the codebase. |

A finished ticket moves to [`done/`](done/) with its acceptance criteria ticked, and is marked ✅ in
the tables below. Where the implementation had to deviate from the ticket, the reason is appended to
the moved file under **Implementation notes** — read those before starting a ticket that depends
on it.

## Definition of done (applies to every ticket)

A ticket is done when **all** of the following are true. Tickets do not restate these.

1. `make lint test build` is green locally and in CI.
2. `make generate && git diff --exit-code` is clean — no stale generated code.
3. New behaviour has tests at the layer described in the ticket's **Tests** section.
4. No new `TODO`, commented-out code, or `panic()` on a reachable path.
5. No package-level database global. Repositories and services take dependencies via constructor
   arguments (`PLAN.md` §6).
6. Anything a future reader would find surprising is a comment; anything an operator needs is in
   `docs/`.
7. The PR description says what was tested and how, and links this ticket file.

## Conventions the whole backlog assumes

- **Module path** — `github.com/bryanster/blacklight` (unchanged from v1).
- **Spec-first.** `api/openapi.yaml` is edited *before* the Go or TS side. Hand-writing a handler
  signature or a fetch call that isn't in the spec is a review rejection.
- **Errors.** All API errors use the single problem shape defined in `M0B-007`. No ad-hoc JSON.
- **Time.** Store UTC, `TIMESTAMP` columns, serialize as RFC 3339. Never format a time for display
  on the server.
- **IDs.** UUIDv7 (`github.com/google/uuid` v1.6+ `uuid.NewV7`), stored as `TEXT`. Sortable by
  creation, so `ORDER BY id` is a stable tiebreaker.
- **Migrations are append-only.** Never edit a migration that has been merged; add a new one.
- **SQL stays portable ANSI.** No DuckDB-only syntax outside `internal/store/duckdb/`, so the
  escape hatch in `PLAN.md` §1 stays real.

## M0b — Foundations

Goal: an empty but *correct* skeleton. At the end of M0b, `docker compose up` serves a React page
that calls a generated, spec-validated API endpoint backed by DuckDB, and CI proves it.

Build in this order — the dependency chain is real.

## M1 — Identity & access

Goal: nobody can do anything they shouldn't, and there is one place that decides. Every ticket
here traces to a named defect in `PLAN.md` §4 — the regression cases are the point.

| [M1-018](done/M1-018-admin-token-management.md) ✅ | Administrative service token management | S |

## M2 — Content

Goal: reference content is installable from the UI, not seeded as a 1 GB git clone. Sources are
enabled, synced, versioned and disabled; ATT&CK versions coexist; Atomic structure is preserved.
Decisions are locked in [`M2-EPIC.md`](done/M2-EPIC.md).

Build roughly in this order — the dependency chain is real.

| ID | Title | Size |
|---|---|---|
| [M2-001](done/M2-001-content-schema.md) ✅ | `content` schema: sources, versions, jobs, raw snapshots, seed rows | L |
| [M2-002](done/M2-002-source-registry-api.md) ✅ | Source registry API, enable/disable/delete, authz actions | M |

| [M2-016](done/M2-016-sync-write-load-test.md) ✅ | Sync write load test (serialized writer fairness) | M |

## M3 — Core domain

Goal: Engagement → Scenario → Step → Execution, scored in ATT&CK Evaluations terms, with evidence,
comments, and findings. **No retest rounds in v1** — operators recreate the assessment
(`M3-EPIC` decisions; deliberate `PLAN.md` deviation). Decisions are locked in
[`M3-EPIC.md`](done/M3-EPIC.md).

Build roughly in this order — the dependency chain is real. **M3-016 is a gate before M4–M6.**

| ID | Title | Size |
|---|---|---|
| [M3-001](done/M3-001-domain-schema.md) ✅ | `app` domain schema: engagement, scenario, step, execution, finding, evidence, comment | L |

| [M3-016](done/M3-016-concurrency-load-test.md) ✅ | War-room concurrency load test (**gate before M4–M6**) | M |

## M4 — Collaboration

Goal: one shared war room — SSE live updates derived from the activity log, presence, live
comments and activity rail, blind mode correct on the wire, reconnect catch-up via
`Last-Event-ID`. Decisions are locked in [`M4-EPIC.md`](done/M4-EPIC.md).

Build roughly in this order — the dependency chain is real. **M4-010 is a gate before M5–M6.**

| ID | Title | Size |
|---|---|---|

| [M4-010](done/M4-010-sse-load-gate.md) ✅ | SSE war-room load test (**gate before M5–M6**) | M |

## M5 — Analytics

Goal: the workbook becomes the numbers a programme is judged on — coverage, detection distribution,
protection rate, MTTD, findings burndown, and the baseline-vs-retest delta — computed in **SQL, not
application loops** (`PLAN.md` §5). One source, two consumers: every number the dashboard shows is
the number an M6 report block prints, from the same query. Decisions are locked in
[`M5-EPIC.md`](M5-EPIC.md).

Build roughly in this order — the dependency chain is real. **M5-015 is a gate before M6.**

| ID | Title | Size |

## M6 — Reporting

Goal: section-picker report builder over a **block registry**, one HTML rendering path shared by
draft preview, immutable published versions, login-required share views, and PDF (`PLAN.md` §5, §8).
M6 is the usability bar — the branch is mergeable once it lands. Decisions are locked in
[`M6-EPIC.md`](M6-EPIC.md).

Build roughly in this order — the dependency chain is real. **M5-015 is a gate before M6.**
**M6-015** (PLAN.md §9 E2E thesis, M5 rewrite) is the M6 exit gate.

| ID | Title | Size |

## M7 — Cutover

Goal: ship **`v1.0.0`** — docs and README operator-ready, GHCR multi-arch + GitHub Release, backup /
upgrade path, security and performance checklists green, historical `v1-final` tag in place.
M6-015 remains the product thesis gate; M7 is the shippability gate. Decisions are locked in
[`M7-EPIC.md`](M7-EPIC.md).

Build roughly in this order — the dependency chain is real. **M7-001 is unblocked and should land
immediately.** **M7-009** is the exit gate. **M7-010…M7-012** are High findings from
[`docs/SECURITY_FINDINGS.md`](../SECURITY_FINDINGS.md) and are ship gates; **M7-013** and
**M7-014** are Medium and are not silent-defer.
