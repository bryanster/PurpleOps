# Blacklight on Azure Container Apps — a fully worked Terraform example.
#
# Deploys the published container image to Azure Container Apps (Azure's
# serverless-container service; the Azure equivalent of "Cloud Run"), with:
#
#   * the database and evidence on an Azure Files share in a Storage Account,
#   * the session secret and encryption key generated here and kept in Key Vault.
#
# The two application secrets are handled with Terraform's ephemeral values and
# write-only arguments: they are generated during apply, sent straight to Key
# Vault, and never written to state or to the plan file. See "secrets" below.
#
# The only prerequisite is an `az login` session. See README.md for the full
# walkthrough, the first-administrator step, and the operational caveats.
